# Focus Potion

Pomodoro Technique powered by Elm.

# How to Build

* Install Brunch (`npm install -g brunch`)
* Clone this project
* Run `brunch watch --server` on the cloned directory root.
* Open the `http://localhost:3333` and enjoy :)

This setup is live reloading, meaning each time you change the Elm code and save the file it will be quickly reflected on the page.
